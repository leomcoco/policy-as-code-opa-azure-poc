# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This repository is a proof-of-concept (PoC). Security fixes will be applied to the `main` branch.
Tagged releases (`vX.Y.Z`) reflect the state of the PoC at that point in time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue with exploit details.
2. Prefer reporting privately by:
   - Opening a GitHub Security Advisory (Security tab → “Report a vulnerability”), or
   - Contacting the repository maintainers via a private channel agreed by the team.

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (safe, minimal)
- Affected files/paths (if known)
- Any suggested remediation (if you have one)

## Response Expectations
We will acknowledge the report and provide next steps. Timelines depend on severity and maintainer availability.
